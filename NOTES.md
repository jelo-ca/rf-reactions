# NOTES — decisions, deviations, results

## Phase 0 — Fetch & cache

### Environment
- Windows 11, Python 3.13.7 via `py` launcher (venv: `pipeline/.venv`), Node 22.18, npm 11.13.
- Pinned Phase 0 deps: see `pipeline/requirements.txt`.

### Deviations from PLAN.md
| Deviation | Why |
|---|---|
| `DEMO_SETS = ["ALL"]` (all 8 Riftcodex sets) instead of `OGN` | Human choice (H1). ~1.45k printings → bigger embeddings (~67MB at 1280-d × 9 rows) and harder accuracy; expect PCA (§6.3) in Phase 1. |
| `pipeline/http.py` → `pipeline/httpclient.py` | `http.py` shadows stdlib `http`, breaking `requests`. |
| Extra helpers `rawcache.py`, `cardsio.py`, `imagehashing.py` | Keep fetch scripts thin, logic testable. |
| `PriceSource` takes cards.csv rows (dicts), not `CardRecord`s | Matching happens after image/hash columns exist. |
| `fetch_prices.py --rematch` flag | Re-apply `manual_overrides.csv` on the cached snapshot with 0 requests (H3 loop). `--force` still = new snapshot. |
| Landscape cards (71 battlefields) are rotated 90° to portrait at download | Guide box is portrait; card is held sideways. Phase 1 augment should also add the 180° rotation (either sideways direction). |
| Images are `pHash`-canonicalized per name (Hamming ≤ 4 → same hash) | Contract “same hash = same picture”; re-encodes differ by a few bits. |

### Card source: Riftcodex
- Endpoints: `GET /sets?size=100`, `GET /cards?set_id=<S>&page=<n>&size=100&sort=collector_number`. 20 requests total for all sets.
- Raw: `data/raw/riftcodex/20260925T203217Z`.
- Sets: OGN 352, OGS 24, SFD 288, UNL 280, VEN 358, PR 13, JDG 3, OPP 133 → 1451 records.
- `printing_id` = `<SET>-<riftbound_id number segment>` upper-cased, `*`→`S` (e.g. `OGN-007A`, `OGN-299S`, `SFD-T03`).
- Source quirks handled:
  - No `public_code` field; `collector_number` is an int without the variant suffix → use `riftbound_id` segment.
  - 28 OPP `(Metal)` cards share `riftbound_id` + image with the plain promo → suffix `M` (e.g. `OPP-017M`).
  - 6 VEN runes duplicated (stale record without tcgplayer_id) → deduped.
  - Names carry tags `(Alternate Art)`, `(Overnumbered)`, `(Signature)`, `(Metal)`, … → stripped to base name so printings group by card.
  - Variant: set in {PR, JDG, OPP} or rarity `Promo` → `promo`; alternate_art/overnumbered/signature → `alt_art`; else `normal`.

### Price source: TCGCSV
- Category 89 verified. Group match by abbreviation first — Riftcodex's OPP id (24343) is actually PR's group; VEN has none (TCGCSV 24698).
- `subTypeName` values: `Normal`, `Foil`. Many cards are Foil-only → base printing takes the Foil price; `F` foil row only when both exist.
